## Objective

Create a model that achieves high accuracy in classifying air pollution images into one of the following six classes:

* f\_Severe
* e\_Very_Unhealthy
* d\_Unhealthy
* c\_Unhealthy_for_Sensitive_Groups
* b\_Moderate
* a\_Good.

Evaluate your model's performance by providing the F1 score for each class, along with the ROC AUC score and graph. Additionally, calculate the overall Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and any other relevant metrics.
Present the confusion matrix for the six classes separately for the training, validation, and testing sets.
